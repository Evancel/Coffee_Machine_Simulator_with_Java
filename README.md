##the Coffee Machine Simulator with Java project


<div>
<p>What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy. :coffee:<br>
In this project, I designed a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.<br> 
Working on this project I understood better the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes. :star: </p>
